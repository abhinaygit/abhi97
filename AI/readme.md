TOPIC: A review on Edge Artificial intelligence (Edge AI) on smart energy management
Introduction:
“Towards zero CO2 emissions society, large shares of renewable energy sources and storage
systems are integrated into microgrids as part of the electrical grids for energy exchange aiming
to effectively reduce the stress from the transmission grid. However, energy management within
and across microgrids is complicated due to many uncertainties such as imprecise knowledge on
energy production and demand, which makes energy optimization challenging.”
