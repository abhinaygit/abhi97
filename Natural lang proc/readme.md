The project is about recognizing the meaning of the dutch words with the help of vast amount of english texts as training data.
I used nltk and regex libraries primarily.
First I generated a language model for english and seperated the words into unigrams and bigrams.
Preprocess the Text: Before training the model, we need to preprocess the text to clean it and make it suitable for language modeling. This may involve steps such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, handling special characters, and handling any language-specific preprocessing tasks.

Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into individual words or tokens. In NLTK, we can use tokenization tools such as word_tokenize or regexp_tokenize to tokenize the text. For languages like French, which may have different tokenization rules compared to English, we may need to customize the tokenization process accordingly.

Build the Language Model: Once the text is tokenized, we can use NLTK to build the language model. One common approach is to use n-gram models, where we calculate the probability of each word or sequence of words based on their frequency in the training data. NLTK provides tools for training n-gram models and calculating probabilities.

Evaluate the Model: After training the language model, we can evaluate its performance using metrics such as perplexity or accuracy on a separate validation dataset. This helps us assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Use the Model: Once the language model is trained and evaluated, we can use it to generate text, perform language-related tasks such as part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition, or integrate it into other applications for natural language processing tasks in the chosen language.

In summary, developing a language model for a random language using NLTK involves acquiring training data, preprocessing the text, tokenizing it, building the language model, evaluating its performance, and using it for various natural language processing tasks. The NLTK library provides tools and utilities for each of these steps, making it a valuable resource for language modeling and text processing tasks.

# As the english text files are of huge data I am not uploading the text files. Instead you can train the model using random text files of english and test it with any language.
